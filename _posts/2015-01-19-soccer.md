title: My Reading List
---

I'd like to share some of the books I like very much. Some of them are just for fun, some of them do inspire me a lot. Here I list them in different buckets with my feeling.

### Computer Science
#### Machine learning
* **[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738)**. Many many people recommend me to read this book for ML. This is my 2020 goal. Mark here for reminder

### Economic
* **[Principles of Economics by N. Gregory Mankiw](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-7th-Gregory-Mankiw/dp/128516587X/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Principle+of+Economics&qid=1561610018&s=books&sr=1-3):** Highly recommend this book for an Economics beginner. This book is beginner-friendly and covering both micro & macro area in Economics. This book is the textbook of the American economics AP course in many schools, which justifies the correctness & readability of this book. As for me, I began understanding some of the economics concepts spread across media after reading this book. It is a pity not to read this book at a young age.

### Investment
* **[The Little Book of Common Sense Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing-ebook/dp/B075Z6HSCJ):** When I just began to work and had no idea about investment, this book inspired me to do my first trade. This book is authored by [John C. Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle) who was the founder of Vanguard. It is a great opportunity to listen to one of the greatest investors in history about his opinion on how to / what to do investment. This book listed a large number of statistics and analyzed the logic behind it. A great short book to start thinking like a real investor instead of a speculator. The conclusion of this book is super simple, stock across the whole market + a certain amount of bonds to hedge risk. Compound interest in many years will shock you.

* **[The Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Collins-Business-Essentials-ebook/dp/B000FC12C8/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Intelligent+investor&qid=1587324032&s=digital-text&sr=1-3):** One of the bibles of investments, you shouldn't miss this book if you are interested in investment.
