Circuit switch and packet switch

Packet-switched networks typically use a strategy called store-and-forward. As the name suggests, each node in a store-and-forward network first receives a complete packet over some link, stores the packet in its internal memory, and then forwards the complete packet to the next node. In contrast, a circuit-switched network first establishes a dedicated circuit across a sequence of links and then allows the source node to send a stream of bits across this circuit to a destination node. The major reason for using packet switching rather than circuit switching in a computer network is efficiency, discussed in the next subsection.

Gateway/Router

Given the enormous diversity of network types, we also need a way to interconnect disparate networks and links (i.e., deal with heterogeneity). Devices that perform this task, once called gateways, are now mostly known as routers, or alternatively, Layer 3 (L3) switches. The protocol that was invented to deal with interconnection of disparate network types, the Internet Protocol (IP), is the topic of our second section.


Datagrams vs Virtual Circuit Switching vs Souce routing
https://book.systemsapproach.org/internetworking/switching.html

* **Datagrams**: The idea behind datagrams is incredibly simple: You just include in every packet enough information to enable any switch to decide how to get it to its destination. That is, every packet contains the complete destination address. Consider the example network illustrated in Figure 57, in which the hosts have addresses A, B, C, and so on. To decide how to forward a packet, a switch consults a forwarding table (sometimes called a routing table), an example of which is depicted in Table 5. This particular table shows the forwarding information that switch 2 needs to forward datagrams in the example network. It is pretty easy to figure out such a table when you have a complete map of a simple network like that depicted here; we could imagine a network operator configuring the tables statically. It is a lot harder to create the forwarding tables in large, complex networks with dynamically changing topologies and multiple paths between destinations. That harder problem is known as routing and is the topic of a later section. We can think of routing as a process that takes place in the background so that, when a data packet turns up, we will have the right information in the forwarding table to be able to forward, or switch, the packet.


* **Virtual Circuit**: A second technique for packet switching uses the concept of a virtual circuit (VC). This approach, which is also referred to as a connection-oriented model, requires setting up a virtual connection from the source host to the destination host before any data is sent. To understand how this works, consider Figure 58, where host A again wants to send packets to host B. We can think of this as a two-stage process. The first stage is “connection setup.” The second is data transfer. We consider each in turn. (Used in VPC, ATM)

* **Source Routing**: A third approach to switching that uses neither virtual circuits nor conventional datagrams is known as source routing. The name derives from the fact that all the information about network topology that is required to switch a packet across the network is provided by the source host.


## Ethernets
To begin, suppose you have a pair of Ethernets that you want to interconnect. One approach you might try is to put a repeater between them. This would not be a workable solution, however, if doing so exceeded the physical limitations of the Ethernet. (Recall that no more than two repeaters between any pair of hosts and no more than a total of 2500 m in length are allowed.) An alternative would be to put a node with a pair of Ethernet adaptors between the two Ethernets and have the node forward frames from one Ethernet to the other. This node would differ from a repeater, which operates on bits, not frames, and just blindly copies the bits received on one interface to another. Instead, this node would fully implement the Ethernet’s collision detection and media access protocols on each interface. Hence, the length and number-of-host restrictions of the Ethernet, which are all about managing collisions, would not apply to the combined pair of Ethernets connected in this way. This device operates in promiscuous mode, accepting all frames transmitted on either of the Ethernets, and forwarding them to the other.



#### VLANs:
One limitation of switches is that they do not scale. It is not realistic to connect more than a few switches, where in practice few typically means “tens of.” One reason for this is that the spanning tree algorithm scales linearly; that is, there is no provision for imposing a hierarchy on the set of switches. A second reason is that switches forward all broadcast frames. While it is reasonable for all hosts within a limited setting (say, a department) to see each other’s broadcast messages, it is unlikely that all the hosts in a larger environment (say, a large company or university) would want to have to be bothered by each other’s broadcast messages. Said another way, broadcast does not scale, and as a consequence L2-based networks do not scale.


## Internet (IP)
#### Datagram Delivery

#### IP address format: 

#### How does router deliver packages based on IP address? 

##### [Subnetting and Classless Addressing](https://book.systemsapproach.org/internetworking/basic-ip.html#subnetting-and-classless-addressing)

We have now seen the basic mechanisms that IP provides for dealing with both heterogeneity and scale. On the issue of heterogeneity, IP begins by defining a best-effort service model that makes minimal assumptions about the underlying networks; most notably, this service model is based on unreliable datagrams. IP then makes two important additions to this starting point: (1) a common packet format (fragmentation/reassembly is the mechanism that makes this format work over networks with different MTUs) and (2) a global address space for identifying all hosts (ARP is the mechanism that makes this global address space work over networks with different physical addressing schemes). On the issue of scale, IP uses hierarchical aggregation to reduce the amount of information needed to forward packets. Specifically, IP addresses are partitioned into network and host components, with packets first routed toward the destination network and then delivered to the correct host on that network

##### Does every host have a public IP address? 


##### [Address Translation (ARP)](https://book.systemsapproach.org/internetworking/basic-ip.html#address-translation-arp)
How to get a datagram to a particular host or router on that network. The main issue is that IP datagrams contain IP addresses, but the physical interface hardware on the host or router to which you want to send the datagram only understands the addressing scheme of that particular network. Thus, we need to translate the IP address to a link-level address that makes sense on this network (e.g., a 48-bit Ethernet address). We can then encapsulate the IP datagram inside a frame that contains that link-level address and send it either to the ultimate destination or to a router that promises to forward the datagram toward the ultimate destination.


##### [DHCP](https://book.systemsapproach.org/internetworking/basic-ip.html#host-configuration-dhcp)
DHCP is to help a host dynamically get an IP address when it starts. 

##### [ICMP](https://book.systemsapproach.org/internetworking/basic-ip.html#error-reporting-icmp)
ICMP defines a collection of error messages that are sent back to the source host in IP layer. 

##### [VPC](https://book.systemsapproach.org/internetworking/basic-ip.html#virtual-networks-and-tunnels)
We want more controlled connectivity.

One implementation way is to use Virtual Circuit. Another is to use [IP tunnel](https://book.systemsapproach.org/internetworking/basic-ip.html#virtual-networks-and-tunnels). We can think of an IP tunnel as a virtual point-to-point link between a pair of nodes that are actually separated by an arbitrary number of networks. The virtual link is created within the router at the entrance to the tunnel by providing it with the IP address of the router at the far end of the tunnel. Whenever the router at the entrance of the tunnel wants to send a packet over this virtual link, it encapsulates the packet inside an IP datagram. The destination address in the IP header is the address of the router at the far end of the tunnel, while the source address is that of the encapsulating router. (simply wraps the packet inside an IP header that is destined for the foreign agent and transmits it into the internetwork). ssh tunnel:

## Routing: 

### Intradomain: (small network)

Given cost of any two nodes, to find the shortest path. 

#### Distance-Vector (RIP)
Bellman-Ford distributed algo to sycn among nodes. https://book.systemsapproach.org/internetworking/routing.html#distance-vector-rip

#### Link State (OSPF)
A protocal to create a complete topology of the network and then calculate the shortest path. 

#### Metrics: 
How to measure cost. A variant of `Delay = (DepartTime - ArrivalTime) + TransmissionTime + Latency`


### Interdomain: (Scaling to Billions)

Even though each router does not need to know about all the hosts connected to the internet, it does, in the model described so far, need to know about all the networks connected to the internet

**ABR**: area border router; 

**BGP**: 
Let’s return to the real question: How does all this help us to build scalable networks? First, the number of nodes participating in BGP is on the order of the number of autonomous systems, which is much smaller than the number of networks. Second, finding a good interdomain route is only a matter of finding a path to the right border router, of which there are only a few per AS. Thus, we have neatly subdivided the routing problem into manageable parts, once again using a new level of hierarchy to increase scalability. The complexity of interdomain routing is now on the order of the number of autonomous systems, and the complexity of intradomain routing is on the order of the number of networks in a single AS.

iBGP & eBGP combined together to propagate border rounter info both across AS and inside AS. 


#### NAT: https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-network-address-translation

> Several internal addresses can be NATed to only one or a few external addresses by using a feature called Port Address Translation (PAT) which is also referred to as "overload", a subset of NAT functionality.

> PAT uses unique source port numbers on the Inside Global IP address to distinguish between translations. Because the port number is encoded in 16 bits, the total number could theoretically be as high as 65,536 per IP address.

> PAT will attempt to preserve the original source port, if this source port is already allocated PAT will attempt to find the first available port number starting from the beginning of the appropriate port group 0-511, 512-1023 or 1024-65535.

> If there is still no port available from the appropriate group and more than one IP address is configured, PAT will move to the next IP address and try to allocate the original source port again. This continues until it runs out of available ports and IP addresses.

## E2E protocols: 

*TCP&UDP*

Flow control involves preventing senders from over-running the capacity of receivers. Congestion control involves preventing too much data from being injected into the network, thereby causing switches or links to become overloaded.
