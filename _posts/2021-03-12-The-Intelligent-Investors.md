title: The Intelligent Investor

It is worth recording some of the essence from "The Intelligent Investors". I will focus on "enterprising investors" first, complete the "passive investors" later.

Enterprising investors: "Starts from Chapter 7" 
* no outstanding rewards came from diversified investment in growth companies as compared with that in common stocks generally.

Graham suggests 3 ways to identify investment opportunities: 

|Strategy| Why | How | statistics | exceptions
|--|--|--|--|--|
| The relatively unpopular large company: | 1. They have the resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adversity and back to tha satifactory earning base. 2. The market is likely to repond with reasonable speed to any improvement shown. | six or ten issues in the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their current or previous year's earnings.| 45 years backtracking, 30%-100% more | individual companies that are inherently speculative because of varying earning tend to sell both at a relatively high price and a relatively low multiplier.
