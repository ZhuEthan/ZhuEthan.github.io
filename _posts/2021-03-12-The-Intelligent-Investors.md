**Some key words:**
* Working Capital: Working capital, also known as net working capital (NWC), is the difference between a company’s current assets—such as cash, accounts receivable/customers’ unpaid bills, and inventories of raw materials and finished goods—and its current liabilities, such as accounts payable and debts.

* Book Value: The book value of a company is the net difference between that company's total assets and total liabilities, where book value reflects the total value of a company's assets that shareholders of that company would receive if the company were to be liquidated.



It is worth recording some essence from "The Intelligent Investors". I will focus on "enterprising investors" first, complete the "passive investors" later.

Enterprising investors: "Starts from Chapter 7" 
* no outstanding rewards came from diversified investment in growth companies as compared with that in common stocks generally.

Graham suggests 3 ways to identify investment opportunities: 

|Strategy| why low|Why up| How | statistics | exceptions
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| The relatively unpopular large company: | unsatisfactor developments of a temporary nature| 1. They have the resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adversity and back to tha satifactory earning base. 2. The market is likely to repond with reasonable speed to any improvement shown. | six or ten issues in the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their current or previous year's earnings.| 45 years backtracking, 30%-100% more compared to index | individual companies that are inherently speculative because of varying earning tend to sell both at a relatively high price and a relatively low multiplier. 
| Purchase of bargin issues (mid-size company) | current dispointing results and protracted neglect or unpopularity |return to value soon  | it is indicated value is at least 50% more than the price, common stock that sells for less than the company's net working capital alone.   |each of the groups advanced in the two years to somewhere in the neighborhood of the aggregate net-current asset. The gain of the entire portfolio in that period was 75% against 50% for S&P, What's more remarkable is that none of the issues showed significant losses, seven held about even, and 78 showed appreciable gains,  **But please diversify** P166 | require and indication of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past decade or more|
| Purchase of bargin issues (small-cap companies)| ~ |1. The divident return is relatively high. The reinvested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will ultimately affect the price. 3. A bull market is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; this it tends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level 4. even during relatively featureless market periods a continuous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary issues that were undervalued may rise at least to a normal level 5. the specific factor that in many cases made for a disappointing record of earnings may be corrected by the advent of new conditions 6. Being acquired will be paid more than bargain level |~|depression years small cap might not perform well|
|Special Situations, or "Workouts"|"Never buy into a lawsuit" causes bargain opportunities|acquisition usually offer a price considerably above the current level | be careful, needs ample experience|| In recent years, arbitrages and workous became risker and less profitable|

Some interesting facts: 

1. From 1960 to 1999, only 8/top 150 companies on the fortune 500 list mainaged to raise their earning by an annual average of at least 15% for two decades. 
2. Looking at fave decades of data, 10% of the large US companies had increased their earnings by 20% for at least 5 consecutive years; only 3% had grown by 20% for at least 10 year straight; and not a single one had done it for 15 years in a row. -


## Charpter 11: Security Analysis for the Lay Investor

What are the primary tests of safety of a corporate bond or preferred stock? 
* Coporate bonds: The number of times that total interest charges have been covered by available earnings for some years in the past. 
* In the case of prefered stock. it is the number of times that bond interest and preferred dividents combined have been covered. 

What are the chief factors entering into the valuation of a common stock? 
* General Long term Prospects (might be wrong)
* Management
* Financial Strength and Capital Structure
* Dividend Record
* Current Dividend Rate

Composite or group estimates are likely to be a good deal more dependable than those for individual companies. 

`Value = Current Earning * (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth)`

The expected annual growth rate should be that expected over the next seven to 10 years. 

What the valuer actually does in these cases is to introduce a margin of safety into his calculations. 

Questions to be answered from financial statement:

1. What makes this company grow? 
2. Where do its profits come from? 

Specifically: 

**Negative:**
* The company is a "serial acquirer". An average of more than two or three acquisitions a year is a sign of potential trouble. After all, if the company itself would rather buy the stock of other busincessesthan invest in its own, shouldn't you take the hint and look elsewhere, too? 
* The company is an OPM addict (Other people's money). Borrowing debt or seeling stock to raise boatloads of other people's money. Cash flow statement: operating activities is always negative, financing activity is always positive. 
* The Company is Johnny-One-Note, relying on one customer for most of its revenues. 

**Positive:** 
* Wide "moat". Several foces can widen a company's moat: 
	* A strong brand identiy; 
	* A monopoly or near-monopoly on the market; 
	* Economies of scale, or the ability to supply huge amounts of goods or services cheaply. 
	* A unique intangible asset
	* A resistance to substituion. 
* The company is a marathoner. earning as grown smoonthly and steadily over the previous 10 years. 
* The company sows and reaps: spend some money on R&D. 

## Charpter 12: Earning per share

**The margin of the market's pricing errors is often not wide enough to justify the expense of trading on them.**
* Corporate accounting is often tricky
* Security analysis can be complicated
* Stock valuations are really dependable only in exceptional cases

**Use of Average earnings**
* The special charges and credits are included in the average earnings. 

*We suggest that the growth rate itself be calculated by comparing the average of the last three years with. corresponding figures ten years earlier*

Why earning on capital funds is the decisive factor for ALCOA? 

* Intelligent investor must always be on a guard for "nonrecurring" costs just keep going.
