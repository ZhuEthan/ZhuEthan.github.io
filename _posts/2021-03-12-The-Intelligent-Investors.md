title: The Intelligent Investor
---



It is worth recording some essence from "The Intelligent Investors". I will focus on "enterprising investors" first, complete the "passive investors" later.

Enterprising investors: "Starts from Chapter 7" 
* no outstanding rewards came from diversified investment in growth companies as compared with that in common stocks generally.

Graham suggests 3 ways to identify investment opportunities: 

|Strategy| why low|Why up| How | statistics | exceptions
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| The relatively unpopular large company: | unsatisfactor developments of a temporary nature| 1. They have the resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adversity and back to tha satifactory earning base. 2. The market is likely to repond with reasonable speed to any improvement shown. | six or ten issues in the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their current or previous year's earnings.| 45 years backtracking, 30%-100% more compared to index | individual companies that are inherently speculative because of varying earning tend to sell both at a relatively high price and a relatively low multiplier. 
| Purchase of bargin issues (mid-size company) | current dispointing results and protracted neglect or unpopularity |return to value soon  | it is indicated value is at least 50% more than the price, common stock that sells for less than the company's net working capital alone.   |each of the groups advanced in the two years to somewhere in the neighborhood of the aggregate net-current asset| require and indication of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past decade or more|
| Purchase of bargin issues (small-cap companies)| ~ |1. The divident return is relatively high. The reinvested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will ultimately affect the price. 3. A bull market is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; this it tends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level 4. even during relatively featureless market periods a continuous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary issues that were undervalued may rise at least to a normal level 5. the specific factor that in many cases made for a disappointing record of earnings may be corrected by the advent of new conditions 6. Being acquired will be paid more than bargain level |~|depression years small cap might not perform well|
|Special Situations, or "Workouts"|"Never buy into a lawsuit" causes bargain opportunities|acquisition usually offer a price considerably above the current level | be careful, needs ample experience|| In recent years, arbitrages and workous became risker and less profitable|

Some interesting facts: 

1. From 1960 to 1999, only 8/top 150 companies on the fortune 500 list mainaged to raise their earning by an annual average of at least 15% for two decades. 
2. Looking at fave decades of data, 10% of the large US companies had increased their earnings by 20% for at least 5 consecutive years; only 3% had grown by 20% for at least 10 year straight; and not a single one had done it for 15 years in a row. -
