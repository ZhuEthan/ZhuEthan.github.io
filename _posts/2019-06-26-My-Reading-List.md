All opinions are wrong, but some are useful. 

### Computer Science
#### Machine learning
* **[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738)**. Many many people recommend me to read this book for ML. This is my 2020 goal. Mark here for reminder

#### Computer System
* **[Computer Systems A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-Engineering/dp/0134123832/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective&qid=1609033818&sr=8-2)**. Famous [CMU 15213](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/) textbook. It describes how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communication. To me, it is a prerequisite to learn deeper computer system knowledge. It covers some high-level overview of OS, networking. Strongly recommend learning with [CMU lecture video](https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22b96d90ae-9871-4fae-91e2-b1627b43e25e%22) and finish its programming assignment. After finishing them, I better understand what's happening when I am programming and have more confidence in arguing with others about solution efficiencies and feasibility. 

### Economic
* **[Principles of Economics by N. Gregory Mankiw](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-7th-Gregory-Mankiw/dp/128516587X/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Principle+of+Economics&qid=1561610018&s=books&sr=1-3):** Highly recommend this book for an Economics beginner. This book is beginner-friendly and covering both micro & macro area in Economics. This book is the textbook of the American economics AP course in many schools, which justifies the correctness & readability of this book. As for me, I began understanding some of the economics concepts spread across media after reading this book. It is a pity not to read this book at a young age.
* **[The Economics of Money, Banking, and Finanacial Markets](https://www.amazon.com/Economics-Banking-Financial-Markets-MyEconLab-dp-1292094303/dp/1292094303/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=):** An introduction book about what the name is: The Money, Banking and Financial Markets. Though these concepts appeares on the principles of economics, this book provides a deeper insight about how these concepts are working and how these influences what we see on everyday financial news. 

### Investment
* **[The Little Book of Common Sense Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing-ebook/dp/B075Z6HSCJ):** When I just began to work and had no idea about investment, this book inspired me to do my first trade. This book is authored by [John C. Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle) who was the founder of Vanguard. It is a great opportunity to listen to one of the greatest investors in history about his opinion on how to / what to do investment. This book listed a large number of statistics and analyzed the logic behind it. A great short book to start thinking like a real investor instead of a speculator. The conclusion of this book is super simple, stock across the whole market + a certain amount of bonds to hedge risk. Compound interest in many years will shock you.

* **[Investing, the last liberal art](https://www.amazon.com/Investing-Liberal-Columbia-Business-Publishing/dp/0231160100/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Investing%2C+the+last+liberal+art&qid=1609034355&sr=8-1)** It doesn't teach how to read a financial statement; it doesn't teach how to analyze the data behind a stock. However, it tells some natural laws of things that also apply to the investment. It is a book of methodology: after getting a target, which aspects should be considered. The author [Hagstrom](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/author/roberthagstrom/) tries to illustrate [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger)'s  "latticework of mental models" in an understandable way. 

  The core of the "latticework of mental model": In short, learn all the big ideas and how they interrelate, and better, more rational thinking will naturally   follow. These big ideas include physics, biology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, paper, mathematics, decision-making, etc. Putting an analogy from these   ideas to investment also inspires people to observe and redescribe the world around them ------ This is what Munger calls Elementary Worldly Wisdom. 

* **[The Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Collins-Business-Essentials-ebook/dp/B000FC12C8/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Intelligent+investor&qid=1587324032&s=digital-text&sr=1-3):** One of the bibles of investments, you shouldn't miss this book if you are interested in investment.
