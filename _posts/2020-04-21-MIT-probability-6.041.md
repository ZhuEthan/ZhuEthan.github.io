Probability notes from MIT 6.041

Sample Space: \\(\Omega\\)
- List (Set) of possible outcomes
	- Mutually exclusive
	- Collectively exhaustive (At least one of the events must occur)
- To be at the "right graularity"

Axioms:
- Nonnegativity: $\Rho$($A$) $\geq$ 0
- Normalization: $\Rho$($\Omega$) $=$ 1
