## Crucial Conversation

* Opposing Opinions
* Strong Emotions
* High Stakes

#### how to stay focused on what you really want: 
* **Work on me first, us second:** 
* Focus on what you really wants: 
  * How to turn people's response contributing to the goal? 
  * **What do I want for myself? what do I not want for myself? for other (to find a mutual purpose)s? for the relationship?** 
  * How would I behave if this were what I really wanted? 
 * Refuse the fool's choice
   * Balance between peace and honesty ---> Looking for `AND`
   * Clarify what you don't want, add it to what you do want, and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to bring you to dialogue. 	

In summary: always on my first, ask what do I want for myself, don't want; what do I want for others, for the relationship

## Learn to look
#### When does crucial conversation happens: 
* Learn to look at content (goal) and conditions (other people's feeling). 
* Look for when things become crucial. --> make the conversation **safe**
	* physical, emotional, silence, violence --> **people becomre defensive when they no longer feel safe.** 
	* You believe that the other person had your best interest in mind, you felt safe receiving the feedback because you trusted the motives and ability of the other person. 
* My style under stress test: 


#### Silence and Violence
* Silence: Masking, Avoiding, Withdrawing. 
* Violence: 
	* controlling (cutting others off, overstating your facts, speaking in absolutes, changing subjects or using directive questions to control the conversaion)
	* labeling: putting a label on people or ideas so we can dismiss them under a general stereotype or category. 
	* Attacking speaks

## Make it safe
### Step Out, Make it safe, then step back in. 

### Notice which condition is at risk: 
#### Mutual Purpose - the Entrance Condition
* Why talk in the first place. In order for this person to be able to deliver the delicate message, you must hae believed he or she cared about you or about your goals and objectives. That means you trusted his or her purposes so you were willing to listen to some pretty tough feedback. 
	* Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation? 
	* Do they trust my motives? 


#### Mutual Respect -- the Continuance Condition
* People become defending dignity. 
	* Do others believe I respect them? 
	* Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I. When we recognize that we all have weaknesses, it is easier to find a way to respect others. 


#### What to do Once you step out: 
* Apologize: 
* Contrast to fix muiunderstanding:
	* [the don't part]The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don't value the work you put in or that I didn't want to share it with the VP. [the do part]I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular. [issue itself]: Unfortunately, just when I was starting to make the trip out here, an issue came up with the VP that I needed to address right then and ther, or it could have cost us a huge piece of our business. I tell you waht - I'll see if I can get her down here sometime tmr to review your work, She'll be here for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Let's see if we can show off the process improvements you camue up with. 
	* [the don't part] I don't want t o suggest that this problem is yours. The truth is, I think it's ours. I am not trying to put the burden on you. I don't even know what the solutions is. [the do part] What I do want is to be able to talk so that we can understand each other better. Perhaps that will help me change how I am responding to you, too. 
	* [the don't part] I am not interested in discussing why our current relationship is strong and healthy. I can se that it isn't. [the do part]I mearely want to talk about what each of us likes and doesn't like. That way we'll be able to see what we need to do in order to improve and why. [Mutual purpose]My only goal is to come up with some ideas that will make both of us happy. 
	* Let me put this in perspective. [the don't part]I don't want you to think I am not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working together. [the do part] I really do think you are doing a good job. [remediation]This punctuality issue is important to me, and I'd just like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive to that, there are no other issues. 
	* I don't want you to think that I don't apprecaite the time you've taken to keep our checkbook balanced and up to date. I do appreciate it, and I know I certainly couldn't have done nearly as well. I do, however, have some concerns with how we are using the new electronic banking system. 
* Create a Mutual Purpose: 
	* Commit to Seek Mutual purspose. -- It seems like we are both trying to force our view on each other. I commit to stay in this discussion until we have a solution that satisfied both of us. Then what whether safety takes a turn for the better. 
	* Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. 
	* Invent a Mutual Purpose: if after clarifying everyone's purposes you are still at odds, see if you can invent a higher or longer-term purpose that is more motivating thant the ones that keep you in conflict. 
		* I certainly don't want to make winners and losers here. It's far better if we can come up with something that doesn't make one team resetn the other one. We've voted before or flipped a coin, and the losers just ended up resenting the wineners. I am more worried about how we feel about each other than anything else. Let's make sure that whatever we do, we don't drive a wedge in our working relationship. 
* Brainstorm New Strategies:
