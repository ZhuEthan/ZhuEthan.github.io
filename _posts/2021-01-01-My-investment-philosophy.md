1. Try to spread investment more than 4 stocks, each one no more 25% --- Don't lose your principal

Inspired by Charlie Munger's "latticework of mental models", I am interested in coming up with an investment framework for myself when deciding on a stock. I'll consider a company from different perspectives, like a checklist, to see how many criteria this stock meet to make my decision. It will be a long, hard work, and it needs a long time-proof. I will continue to work on this list and have more examples on this.
