As a prerequisite to ML, no one could stress too much about how important statistics are.

**Diff between probability and statistics:**
Probability deals with predicting the likelihood of future events, while statistics involves the analysis of the frequency of past events. Probability is primarily a theoretical branch of mathematics, which studies the consequences of mathematical definitions. Statistics is primarily an applied branch of mathematics, which try to make sense of observations in the real world

**Some interesting fact**
* You replace any estimation by average.

$E(X) = 1/n * \sum_{i=1}^n(X_n-\hat{p})$

$ 2^{\frac{n-1}{3}} $

$ E(X) = 1/n * \sum_{i=1}^n(X_n-\hat{p}) $
